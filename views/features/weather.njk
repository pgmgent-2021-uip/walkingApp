            <h3>Plan With Confidence</h3>
            <p>Most weather apps only provide forecasts for nearby towns. With Trace Tracker weather feature, you'll receive hourly forecasts for the actual hiking location (and elevation). This means that our precipitation, lightning, temperature, and wind forecasts are more accurate when planning your next hiking objective. </p>
            <p>Choose the safest day and time for your adventure. We color-code detailed hourly data so that you can quickly find your best weather window. 5-day hourly forecasts include the chance of precipitation, chance of lightning, temperature, wind speed & direction, and cloud cover.</p>

        <h3> Know Trail Conditions In Advance</h3>
        <p>We use recent weather conditions to estimate if the trail is muddy, a little wet, or dry, and we update this every hour. But don’t take our word – we offer one-click access to a visual history of precipitation and temperature during the past 24 hours so that you can make your own call</p>
