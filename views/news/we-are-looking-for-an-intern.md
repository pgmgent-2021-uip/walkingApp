## We are looking for an Intern


**Intern Required** - Content Creator - 3 Month Full-Time Internship - Paid Position

**Salary Equivalent** - £10.85 an hour (London Living Wage)

**Location** - London or Essex region

Trace-Tracker is a health and wellness company working to increase walking, nature connection and outdoor adventures. We are a small team looking for an amazing intern member to help us create unique content. 

**The ideal teammate:**

- You love people, nature, walking and active travel and want to promote pro-environmental behaviours.

- You are tech-savvy, experienced in social media, enjoy writing, taking good photos and community engagement. 

- You have excellent English speaking and writing abilities, with an eye for grammatical and spelling errors. 

- You’re confident, friendly, light-hearted and proactive by nature. You should be happy to help get things done and ideally be “board-room ready”.

- You’re organised, self-sufficient and are able to manage your time and tasks on your own at times.

- You’re confident working and communicating effectively in a remote or semi-remote working environment.

- You must have a permit to work in the UK and be willing and able to travel at short notice.

- You’ll need a full, clean driving licence. (Ordinarily this wouldn’t be a requirement but due to the current Covid pandemic and restrictions, it is a necessity for this role). 

**Tasks will include:**

We are primarily looking for a self-starter who likes being outdoors or out and about. We have lots of walking routes to map in the coming months so much of the role will be surveying, capturing and uploading walking routes to the Trace-Tracker app. Please note that all routes are tried and tested in person and the chosen candidate will need to be confident doing this alone.

- Supporting the team with ideas for new walks or new app features.

- Writing small content features using tone of voice guidelines such as social media posts, emails, blog posts, event listings et al.

- We’d love for you to attend and contribute creatively to meetings with partners and potential partners as well as the weekly status meetings.

- You’ll need to keep your Trello cards and spreadsheets up to date with completed actions and regularly update the team with progress. 

- We may need ad hoc assistance with testing and quality assurance of the app.

- We may need ad hoc content research and content creation (e.g Canva et al) for social media as well as engaging with our audience, influencers and partners through our key social media channels e.g Instagram et al.

- We may need ad hoc representation at Trace-Tracker events such as trade shows, consumer shows, nature trails and walks, sometimes these happen at the weekend but they are always planned in advance. 

**How to apply and recruitment process:**

**First round** - Apply to [info@tracetracker.com](#) with a short intro (less than 200 words) about yourself, your CV and examples of your social media channels if you are happy to share (don’t worry if not, it’s not a deal-breaker) or portfolio (can be a PDF or a weblink) if you have one.

**Second round** - Max 20 min call on the phone.  Shortlisted candidates will be asked to make a walk using the Trace-Tracker app. It’s important you spend less than an hour on this (including time for your walk).

**Final round** - Max 1hr video interview with two members of the team. 

**Application deadline** - Midnight on 26th Jan 2021

**Ideal start date** - 1st Dec 2021
