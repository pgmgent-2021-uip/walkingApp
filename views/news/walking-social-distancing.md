## Walking & Social Distancing


### On Monday 4th January 2021, the Scottish and English governments announced national lockdowns, joining Wales and Northern Ireland in implementing new national restrictions. In England, this means we are only permitted to exercise once per day either with members of our household or support bubble, or one person outside of our household while maintaining social distancing. We are not permitted to travel outside of our local area to do so and the key message is to stay home.

Having endured previous lockdowns, periods of self-isolation and other restrictions, we know that this will be a challenging time for us all.

From our perspective, our advice is to please enjoy the outdoors sensibly and follow the national rules that apply in your location. Stay local, visit a new local green space to mix it up or go for a longer walk around [your neighbourhood](https://www.google.com). Please take your rubbish home and keep your distance from others. Let people pass by at a safe distance and smile or wave - they almost certainly need it as much as you.

And don't forget, whilst walking, stop and notice the nature all around. You can find updated government [green space guidance here](https://www.google.com).
